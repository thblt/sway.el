;;; Commentary:

;; This is a basic library to control the Sway window manager from
;; Emacs.  Its main use case is in combination with popup managers
;; like Shackle, to 1) use frames instead of windows while still 2)
;; giving focus to existing frames instead of duplicating them.

;; This can probably work with i3 by simply reimplementing `sway-msg';
;; this is left as an exercice to the reader.

;;; Code:

(require 'dash)
(require 'json)

;; * General notes
;;
;; In this package, Emacs frames can be designated in three different
;; ways:
;;
;;  1. As regular Emacs frame objects, that verifies (framep)
;;  3. As Sway container IDs, integers.
;;  3. Or as combinations of both, as cons list (FRAME . WINDOW-ID)
;;
;; In a single case, Sway tree nodes or X-window IDs are used.
